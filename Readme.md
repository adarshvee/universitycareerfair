This repositary is for the database design of an application to completely track an University's career fair. The database has been designed to be extendable. The scripts are for MySQL, but can be modified for different SQL databases.

1) The .pdf file contains the complete Database diagram.
2) The file DDL.sql consists of all the scripts required to create the database.
3) The script DataInsert.sql consists of scripts for inserting some test data. This also includes insertion of lookup values such as countries, states, skills, languages and so on.
4) The directory SampleQueries holds a few sample reports that might be obtained from such a Database. Some of them are scripts for creating Stored Procedures which can be reused. 

I am working on building a front end application to use this Database, and will commit it in a seperate repositary.
